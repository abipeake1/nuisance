This is supposedly the calculated BEBC flux, which is near impossible to find.

It has both the muon and electron fluxes, for both neutrino and anti-neutrinos

It is listed on the PhD thesis archives at CERN as: 

"Neutrino and muon fluxes in the CERN 400 GeV proton beam dump experiments", H. Wachsmuth, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland
CERN/EP 79-125, 18 October 1979

These files live in ./Wachsmuth
============================================
However, this does not agree with the flux published in Sylvia Barlag's thesis (see ../theses) which was defintely correct for BEBC during the runs relevant to her thesis (Dfill and Hfill)

These fluxes live in ./Barlag. For more info and links, please check ../theses and the README
