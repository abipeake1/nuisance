This refers to thesis by Sylvia Barlag (yes, the track/field athelete!), now at IAAF!

Very useful and thorough!

It describes the Deuterium fill of the BEBC experiment.

Has the missing Enu distributions with W < 1.4 GeV cuts. Also includes some anti-neutrino data and CCQE data (CCQE not scanned)

I found this on the IAEA archives, titled "Quasi-elastic interactions and one-pion production by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos on a deuterium target", Sylvia Barlag.

If not OK, email c.wret14@imperial.ac.uk or clarence.wret@gmail.com if we're in the far future (are there hoverboards yet?!)
