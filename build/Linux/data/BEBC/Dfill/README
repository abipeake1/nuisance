Dfill refers to when BEBC ran with Deuterium

Sadly, only W and Q2 distributions had W < 1.4 GeV cuts
All total cross-sections had W < 2.0 GeV, useless if you're tuning Deltas
Includes angular distributions and spherical harmonics in W, and t distributions, and multipions!

If you can't find it on Nucl. Phys. B don't worry; it's on inspireHEP!
I think there was a change of journal name or something...

There are Enu dists for all channels with W < 1.4 GeV cuts in Sylvia Barlag's thesis (check up directory)
