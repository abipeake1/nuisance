Only CC1pi+ on proton with W < 1.4 GeV can be corrected with C. Wilkinson/P. Rodriguez method.
This is because it's the only channel which is given as a ratio to CCQE in Enu. The other channels have W < 2.0 GeV.

The corrected channel's raw data can be found in K.Furuno et al, cited further down under flux

BNL flux is a difficult one to evaluate properly; there are a few different fluxes floating about; most of them derived from CCQE data and a MA fit of ~1.1 GeV. The highest statistics for this was presented at NuInt02 by K. Furuno.

Found at proceedings (if you can find them), or KEK Preprint 2003-48 Septermber 2003, RCNS-03-01

There is also a general flux paper using the same beam configuration but a different detector which larger spatial extent. This should NOT be used because the radial dependence of the flux which the paper cites. It is here only for reference:
