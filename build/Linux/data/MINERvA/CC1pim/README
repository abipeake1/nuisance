MINERvA numubar CC 1pi- data added on 6 May 2021 by S. Gardiner

The data files in this folder are taken from the supplementary materials
included in Phys. Rev. D 100, 052008 (2019), https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08300

For ease of use with NUISANCE, the raw text files have been converted into
a single ROOT file minerva_cc1pim_data.root (located in this folder) which
contains data histograms (TH1D) and covariance matrices (TH2D) for each
measurement in the paper. The ROOT file may be regenerated from the
supplementary materials by running the provided macro dump_minerva_cc1pim.C
from within this folder.

Note that the Enubar measurement given in the supplemental materials does not
appear to match the plot in the body of the paper. I will follow up with
MINERvA collaborators about this.
